### List of Machine Learning Algorithms which is used in ML_projects but which algorithms is apply it's always depend on the datasets:
        1. Linear Regression (regression type problem)
        2. Logistic Regression (classification , regression)
        3. Decision Tree (classification , regression)
        4. SVM (classification , regression)
        5. Naive Bayes (we can used for classification type but not used in regression type because badly worked there... also most used in NLP)
        6. kNN (classification , regression)
        7. K-Means (classification type problem)
        8. Random Forest (classification , regression)
        9. Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms eg. PCA (regression type problem)
        10. Gradient Boosting algorithms :
                a) GBM (classification , regression)
                b) XGBoost (classification , regression)
                c) LightGBM (classification , regression)
                d) CatBoost (regression, classification, multi-class classification and ranking type probelm)
