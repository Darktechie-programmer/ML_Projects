### List of Machine Learning Algorithms which is used by me but which is used algorithms always depend on the dataset:
1. Linear Regression (regression type problem)
2. Logistic Regression (classification , regression)
3. Decision Tree (classification , regression)
4. SVM (classification , regression)
5. Naive Bayes (we can used for classification type but not used in regression type because badly worked there... also most used in NLP)
6. kNN (classification , regression)
7. K-Means (classification type problem)
8. Random Forest (classification , regression)
9. Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms eg. PCA (regression type problem)
10. Gradient Boosting algorithms :
        a) GBM (classification , regression)
        b) XGBoost (classification , regression)
        c) LightGBM (classification , regression)
        d) CatBoost (regression, classification, multi-class classification and ranking type probelm)
